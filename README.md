# Welcome

![Image title](images/nicki_image.png){ width="300", align=right }

Hi, my name is Nicki and I do machine learning research. I am a Associate Professor in the
[Section for Cognitive systems](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/cogsys) at Technical 
University of Denmark (DTU). I consider myself a *jack of all trades, master of none* in machine learning and deep 
learning, having experience with computer vision, NLP, supervised models, generative models, reinforcement learning ect. 
Current research interest are in the intersection of efficient machine learning, designing of machine learning system 
and machine learning operations (MLOps) in general. The last topic I also teach about in this 
[course](https://skaftenicki.github.io/dtu_mlops/) at DTU.

Furthermore, I am a core developer and maintainer of [Lightning AI](https://lightning.ai/), where we develop open-source
software to help researchers scale their models and experiments and not their boilerplate.

Feel free to contact me if you want to work with me. ðŸ˜€
